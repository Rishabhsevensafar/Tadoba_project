                <span>Core Zones - </span>The Tadoba Core Zone is the heart of
                Tadoba National Park, famous for its dense forests, abundant
                biodiversity, and frequent tiger sightings. This zone represents
                the true wilderness of the park, with no human habitation
                allowed. It is a crucial area where wildlife and natural
                resources are carefully conserved and protected by the forest
                department. The entry gates to the Tadoba Core Zone include
                Moharli, Kolara, Khutwanda, Navegaon, Zari, and Pangadi.

                <span>Buffer Zones -</span> The buffer zone, surrounding the
                core area of Tadoba National Park is the forested area where
                villages coexist with wildlife and play a crucial role in
                involving local villagers in tourism. The buffer zones too offer
                excellent opportunities for wildlife sightings. Unlike the core
                zone, the buffer zone remains accessible to tourists year-round,
                including the monsoon season. The entry gates of Tadoba buffer
                zones are - Agarari, Devada-Adegaon, Ramdegi, Navegaon,
                Madnapur, Mamla, Pangadi Aswal Chuha Gate, Srikada, Zari/Peth,
