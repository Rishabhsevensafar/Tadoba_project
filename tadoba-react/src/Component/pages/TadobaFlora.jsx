            <h2>TADOBA NATIONAL PARK FLORA</h2>
            <p>
              Just imagine the national park without flora; itâ€™s like fish out
              of water. Flora is the gem of the park and the forest is
              meaningless and has no virtue if there is no existence in it. The
              embellishment of the national park lies in its essentials so why
              not discover the beauty of nature amidst flora? If you have to see
              the rich botanical family then you should visit Tadoba National
              Park. They are trees, shrubs, herbs, and grasses along with their
              local names, and types of flora.

              <h5>Bija Tree</h5>
              <p>
                This Bija tree is 30 meters tall and is also addressed as a
                pterocarpus Marsupium tree, Basically, it is found in Kerela and
                Karnataka region and is very exclusive in appearance and is
                rarely found.
              </p>
              <h5>Kusum Tree</h5>
              <p>
                This tree has very unique appearance such as a broad, shady
                crown and it basically stays widespread throughout the tropical
                Himalayas. Its red leaves are very attractive and look
                mesmerizing. Flowers are tiny but impressively beautiful with
                pairs of leaflets. March is the best time to see this flower.
              </p>
              <h5>Bark Tree</h5>
              <p>
                During winter, tree stands bare. It looks scissored and cracked,
                so it justifies its name crocodile bark tree. Diarrhoea is
                treated medicinally with the bark.
