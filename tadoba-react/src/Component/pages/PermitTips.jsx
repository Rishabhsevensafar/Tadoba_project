          <h1>TADOBA PERMIT TIPS FOR THE BEGINNERS</h1>
          <p>
            It is always preferable to book an online safari for Tadoba National
            Park. The right gate and right safari knowledge is so important so
            you need to take information from your travel agent. There are two
            safari rides, one is in the morning and the second one is in
            evening. The morning timing is between 6 to 6:30 am while the
            evening timing is 2:30 to 3 pm. Timings are flexible and can be
            changed as per the season. The availability of full day safari is
            also there if you require having then this is the best. The core
            gate and buffer zone safari ride’s tariff also varies so check all
            these minutely before doing online booking. As Tadoba has multiple
            gates in the core and buffer zone in good number so for the
            beginners it is tough to decide on which gate would be best for
            spotting tigers. For a good result you need to book at least two or
            three gates so that chances of viewing the wildlife would be great.
            This beginner’s guide will be very helpful for you guys when going
            to Tadoba Tiger Reserve.
          </p>
          <h5>Accommodations Facility :-</h5>
          <p>
            Plan your Tadoba Trip in Advance- If you plan your trip a few days
            before then you are better prepared with all sorts of travel
            essentials. You should always prefer to book resorts which are
            closer to your already booked gate. For that you need to ask your
            travel agent which accommodations are near your booked gates which
            will save your huge time and energy. Around the gate you will have a
            limited number of resorts and there are Government lodges as well if
            you are comfortable to be there. Also mind that in a few gates there
            are no resorts & hotels and lodging facilities at all. If you are ok
            with staying in the town then Tadoba National Park will be 25 to 30
            km away. Do as per your comfort within all these.
          </p>
          <h5>From Railway Station and Airport Accessibility :-</h5>
          <p>
            As far as railway station is concerned Chandrapur is the nearest
            railway station for a few safari gates of Tadoba National Park while
            for some of the safari gates Nagpur Railway Station is the nearest.
            You need to figure out which gate is closer and it depends on the
            fact that as well from which direction you are heading to the park.
            Pre-decided on that so that your accessibility to the park will be
            smoother and you will not be wandering uselessly. While tourists are
            coming in flights then your landing space would be Nagpur airport as
            it is closest for heading to the Tadoba national park. After that
            you need to take a pre-booked cab from Nagpur or Chandrapur. For the
            cab you need to pay for both sides if you are even taking one sided
            ride. The cab charges depend on the distance of the Core or buffer
            zone gates.
          </p>
          <h5>Food :-</h5>
          <p>
            Generally you are being offered a complete package in most of the
            resorts and there is availability of all three meals as well. The
            morning breakfast sometimes is packed by the resorts so that you can
            have this during your morning safari. When you are staying in
            Government resorts then you have to compromise on this food
            facility. They offer good canteens around and the cost of the food
            per person/per day is quite reasonable and on budget.
          </p>
          <h5>Safari Gate Process :-</h5>
          <p>
            You need to bring a Safari voucher when you are taking your entry to
            the safari gate for a safari ride at the given time. Vouchers should
            have the important details like the name of the tourists
            accompanying in gypsy must be there. You have to show the original
            IDs for verification at the safari gate which you have used while
            online booking. The guide and the driver are owed via the Forest
            department in every permit. Always prefer to reach half an hour
            prior to your safari ride. The fun will be unlimited on open jeep
            safari in which 6 people can be accommodated along with driver and
            guide. Spotting wild animals would be easier and adventure would be
            at its best when in jeep safari.
          </p>
          <h5>Well-Informed Tiger Tracker or Guide :-</h5>
          <p>
            Your trip to the safari will be incomplete if you do not have a
            better tiger tracker for your whole trip. Best tiger tracker will
            take you to the accurate tiger spots where tigers generally dwell.
            So one knowledgeable guide will make your trip worthy and spotting a
            tiger won’t be a big deal for you with him. Go for a better guide
            who has better reviews submitted on his reputation while booking
            online. They can easily track the tiger so choose wisely. You will
            have a quality trip with a better guide.
          </p>
          <h5>Tip for Driver and Guide :-</h5>
          <p>
            You should do this formality. Yes, tipping to the driver and guide
            at the end of safari is just a kind of ritual that you should
            follow.
          </p>
          <h5>Photography :-</h5>
          <p>
            You need to bring a Safari voucher when you are taking your entry to
            the safari gate for a safari ride at the given time. Vouchers should
            have the important details like the name of the tourists
            accompanying in gypsy must be there. You have to show the original
            IDs for verification at the safari gate which you have used while
            online booking. The guide and the driver are owed via the Forest
            department in every permit. Always prefer to reach half an hour
            prior to your safari ride. The fun will be unlimited on open jeep
            safari in which 6 people can be accommodated along with driver and
            guide. Spotting wild animals would be easier and adventure would be
            at its best when in jeep safari.
          </p>
          <h5>Thrilling Wildlife :-</h5>
          <p>
            The wildlife in abundance is here in Tadoba National Park. Apart
            from Tigers there are numbers of other mammals also in the Tadoba
            National Park. Your trip will be amazing with the better guide as it
            will be full of thrills and excitement as he will certainly help you
            to spot many other wild animals apart from Tigers. You need to
            mention to your guide beforehand if you have any specific choice of
            animals or birds.
          </p>
          <h5>Clothes Items :-</h5>
          <p>
            First of all you should carry and wear a mask everywhere you are
            heading in the park. Mask is perfect for the trip as it protects you
            not only from viruses but also from dust. Some warm clothes are a
            must in winter and you should carry boots as well. Be prepared for
            everything, whether in winter it is so unpredictable.
          </p>
          <h5>Network & Communications :-</h5>
          <p>
            There are rare networks that work in Moharli gate and Kolara gate.
            The network connections are irregular. This complete guide will help
            the beginners immensely in planning your trip to Tadoba National
            Park. Back to back we have mentioned all the convenient tips which
            will be worthy while being here in the park. You will not be
            misguided anywhere if you will go through all the travel and permit
            tips out there. I do not think I have left any points still if you
            think I am missing any point you can mention in the comment box.
