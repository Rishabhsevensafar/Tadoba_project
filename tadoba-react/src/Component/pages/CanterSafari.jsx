                <h4>About a Canter Safari</h4>
                <p>
                    A canter is a bus-like structure, bigger in size as compared to
                    the conventional jeeps. Consequently, the seating capacity is
                    also high, thus facilitating a bigger group of tourists to enjoy
                    the safari experience at a single canter safari round. Unlike
                    buses, the sides of the canter are open to enjoy the views of
                    forest landscape and spot wildlife unhindered. The canters in
                    Tadoba can accommodate 22 people at a time, which include a
                    driver and 2 guides.
                    <p>
                    Canter Safaris are conducted in two shifts in both of these
                    reputed zones of Tadoba - morning and evening. The best part
                    of opting for a canter safari is, it is a budget friendly
                    option to venture the forest in full swing
                    </p>
