                <h4>Tadoba’s History in Brief -</h4>
                <p>
                The Tadoba National Park was officially designated as a national
                park in 1955, following its initial establishment as a wildlife
                sanctuary in 1935. Situated within the Tadoba-Andhari Tiger
                Reserve, which was founded in 1995, this park is a vital
                conservation area for wildlife in India.

                <h4>Best Activities in Tadoba National Park</h4>
                <p>
                <span>Jeep Safari -</span> The Jeep Safari is one of the most
                popular and exhilarating activities in Tadoba National Park. This
                guided tour allows visitors to explore deep into the forest,
                offering the best chance to observe the park’s wildlife in their
                natural habitat. The safari, conducted twice daily - once in the
                morning and once in the afternoon - takes tourists through the
                park’s core and buffer zones. Visitors can encounter Bengal
                tigers, leopards, wild dogs, sloth bears, and an abundance of bird
                species. Experienced guides mandatorily accompany the tour,
                providing valuable insights into Tadoba's flora and fauna. Advance
                booking is recommended, as the slots are limited to ensure minimal
                disturbance to the wildlife. Prior bookings for jeep safaris are
                available for both on a private as well as a sharing basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                <span>Canter Safari -</span> For larger groups or families looking
                to explore the park together, the Canter Safari is an excellent
                option. This open-air bus safari accommodates around 20 people and
                operates only through the Kolara and Moharli zones, offering a
                great opportunity to spot tigers and other wildlife. The Canter
                Safari is particularly well-suited for those looking for a more
                affordable alternative to the private or sharing jeep safari,
                without compromising on the chance to witness the national park's
                wildlife. Like the jeep safari, the canter is accompanied by a
                trained guide who helps visitors understand the park’s ecological
                significance.

                up close in a different setting.
