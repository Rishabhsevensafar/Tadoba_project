                    Tadoba National Park is undoubtedly one of the most renowned
                    national parks in India due to its best tiger reserve, which
                    houses countless globally famed tigers. The safari in the
                    Tadoba tiger reserve represents hundreds of thousands of
                    wildlife enthusiasts every year. Though the majestic tigers
                    are the prime attraction in Tadoba but birding is also a
                    drawing attraction here for the bird lovers. Khutwanda Gate is
                    one of six core gates in Tadoba National Park. It is not
