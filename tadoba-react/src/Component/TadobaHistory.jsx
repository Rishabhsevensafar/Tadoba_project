            <h2 className='historyHeading1'>Tadoba National Park History :</h2>
            <p className='historyPara1'>There was a mythological tale, told in parts about a man who became the sanctity. Taru, a Gond tribal from a respected village confronted a prodigious tiger near a lake in his village. A Ferocious battle between the tiger and the man resulted in a disputed conclusionwhere some say that Taru defeated the tiger while others believe that despite his bravery, Taru was executed by the tiger. Regardless of whatever the tale is the man was considered a legend. A Shrine was also constructed in his memory along 
with the lake and the surrounding forested area which is known by the name ‘Tadoba’, from the man’s name ‘Taru’. 
The Bulletin was then passed in the year 1931 stating that the shooting of tigers is prohibited in the national park and the surrounding protected area. With a total area of 45 km surrounded by Tadoba lake, the area has been declared a sanctuary in 1935. In the year 1942, shooting ranges in Tadoba were declared as the game reserves with Karwa, Kalsa, Moharli, and Mul blocks, and the permits being issued in Karwa and Kalsa blocks. Gond Kings governed the territory for several centuries as they did ample for central India. It was established by the Marathas during the 18th century following the British period about a century later.
The Area was declared a reserved forest in the year 1879 and later, in the year 1955, Tadoba became the earliest national park the same year as the Kanha National Park. Even after passing of the bill, overexploitation, hunting and poaching, and extensive cultivation continued. It was during the 1970s that the four hunting blocks were permanently closed due to continued illegal activities. In the year 1986, an area encompassing about 506.32 sq. km was declared as Andhari Wildlife Sanctuary. And in the year 1993, Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) with an area extending up to 622.87 sq. km was established thereby merging the national park and the sanctuary area.</p>
